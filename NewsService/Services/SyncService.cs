///   1. For each team: compare remote index hash vs cached hash; sync changed images.
///   2. Apply both display surfaces — the lock screen and the desktop wallpaper — each from the
///      most-recently-modified active assignment matching its display type, or a configurable
///      default image when no content is active. Both surfaces are picked in a single
///      enumeration pass over the cached team indexes (ActiveAssignmentSelector.PickNewestActive
///      with two predicates), never two separate walks of the index files. The winning image for
///      each surface is re-verified against its signed hash and published to a protected,
///      non-user-writable folder (IImagePublisher, one content-derived namespace per surface)
///      before PersonalizationCSP is pointed at it — not at the ProgramData cache directly.
///      Three-state, registry-driven, and stateless per surface: the live PersonalizationCSP
///      value is the single source of truth. When there is no active content and no usable
///      default, a value NewsService previously published is CLEARED — returning the machine to
///      Windows' own default at the next lock/logon — but a value it did not publish (GPO,
///      Intune, or a manual admin change) is always left alone. Either surface can be disabled
///      independently via Delivery:LockScreenEnabled / Delivery:WallpaperEnabled (both default
///      true) for RDS/VDI/RemoteApp hosts, where one machine-wide value cannot correctly serve
///      many sessions; disabling one is NOT a revert — whatever is currently applied for that
///      surface stays frozen in place. Lock screen applies before wallpaper; each surface is
///      isolated in its own try/catch so a failure in one can never prevent the other from
///      applying. A failed write or clear is never recorded as applied — the next cycle
///      re-evaluates and retries naturally.
///   3. Write status.json.
///   4. Upload session telemetry from the uploads folder.
///
/// NewsViewer no longer applies any wallpaper image — it retains only a small per-user HKCU
/// wallpaper STYLE assertion (style is not covered by PersonalizationCSP and is unreachable from
/// NewsService's session-0 context). See docs/newsviewer-spec.md.
