### NewsCentral

- Detects UPN accounts and supports local accounts
- Azure Blob distribution uses `InteractiveBrowserCredential` (MSAL interactive user session); token persisted in named cache `"NewsCentral"` for non-interactive re-authentication. Config: `AzureBlob:{TenantId, ClientId, AccountName}` in appsettings.json.

### NewsService

- Azure Blob access uses `ClientCertificateCredential` or `ClientSecretCredential`; mode selected by `AzureBlob:AuthMode`
- Certificate loaded from `Cert:\LocalMachine\My` by thumbprint — Local System has access by default, no extra grants required
- Proactive token refresh via `Azure.Identity`; handles weeks-long uptime without restart

### NewsViewer

- Architecture is prepared for future authentication requirement to access `%programdata%\NewsCentral\` data
- No authentication implemented in this version

## Anti-Tamper — HMAC-SHA256

`HmacService` (in `NewsCentral.Shared/Security/`) provides end-to-end content integrity using HMAC-SHA256.

**Signing (NewsCentral):** `index.json` signing has moved to per-team ECDSA (see below); `HmacService` is no longer used for index signing in NewsCentral.

**Signing (NewsViewer):** `TelemetryWriter` calls `HmacService.Sign(record)` on each `SessionTelemetry` before writing to disk.

**Verification (NewsService):**
- `SyncService` verifies each `index.json` via ECDSA (Phase C — see below). HMAC is no longer used for index verification.
- `TelemetryUploader` verifies each `session-*.json` before forwarding. `Invalid` → file discarded and logged.

**Verification (NewsViewer):** `PresentationSelector` verifies each team's `index.json` via ECDSA (Phase C — see below). HMAC is no longer used for index verification. After selecting the winning assignment, `PresentationSelector` also verifies the cached image file against `Content.ImageHash` (SHA-256). A missing hash is accepted with a warning; a mismatch returns `(best, null)` so the caller exits silently. Disabled by `BypassImageIntegrityCheck`.

**Key management:** `Hmac:SecretKey` is a Base64-encoded 32-byte key configured in `appsettings.json` or overridden via registry (`Hmac\SecretKey`). An empty key disables HMAC system-wide — all content is treated as `Disabled` and passes through. This enables phased rollout: deploy the key to all machines before enabling signing in NewsCentral.

**`Signature` field** is present in: `Presentation`, `Schedule`, `Assignment`, `TeamIndexFile`, `SessionTelemetry`.

## Per-Team Asymmetric Signing — ECDSA P-256 (Phases A, B1 & C — implemented and tested)

`EcdsaSignatureService` (in `NewsCentral.Shared/Security/`) provides ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256 signing and verification as the foundation for replacing the shared HMAC key on `index.json` with per-team asymmetric keys. Session telemetry remains on HMAC-SHA256 and is not affected.

**Algorithm:** ECDSA nistP256, SHA-256 hash, IEEE P1363 fixed-field concatenation (64-byte r‖s, Base64). Never DER.

**Canonical payload:** Identical approach to `HmacService` — `Signature` temporarily nulled, non-indented camelCase JSON with `JsonStringEnumConverter`. Signed bytes are byte-for-byte consistent across both services.

**Key material — `TeamSigningKeys`:** Stored at `{teamFolderName}/team-signing.json` on the authoring tier only. Must never be written through `IBlobDistributionService` or synced to client machines.

| Field | Type | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `PrivateKey` | Base64 PKCS#8 | NewsCentral — signs `index.json` |
| `PublicKey` | Base64 SPKI | NewsService, NewsViewer — verify `index.json` |
| `PublicKeyPrevious` | Base64 SPKI (optional) | Both verifiers — rotation window |

**Key rotation:** `Verify<T>` accepts `params string?[] publicKeysSpkiBase64`; pass `[PublicKey, PublicKeyPrevious]` to accept content signed by either key during a rotation window. A key attempt that throws counts as that key failing; `Invalid` is only returned after all supplied keys are exhausted.

**Key management — `SigningKeyTool`:** `GenerateKeyPair()` creates a fresh nistP256 key pair and returns Base64 PKCS#8 + SPKI; `DerivePublicKey()` accepts PEM or raw Base64 PKCS#8; `Truncate()` produces a short display string for the UI.

**Phase A — complete:** `EcdsaSignatureService`, `SigningKeyTool`, and `TeamSigningKeys` are implemented in `NewsCentral.Shared` and covered by `NewsCentral.Shared.Tests` (9 passing xUnit facts): sign/verify round-trip, wrong-key rejection, rotation key-list fallback, `Disabled` and `Unsigned` states, public-key derivation from both Base64 PKCS#8 and PEM input, malformed-input rejection (`ArgumentException`), and tamper detection (mutated payload fails verification).

**Phase B1 — complete:** `IndexGenerationService` (NewsCentral) signs `index.json` with the team's ECDSA private key loaded from `team-signing.json` (authoring tier only; never written through `IBlobDistributionService`). A team with no key is published unsigned with a warning and continues normally — phased-rollout safe. A publish-time self-verify guard was subsequently added (see **Publish-time self-verify guard** below).

**Publish-time self-verify guard:** After signing, `IndexGenerationService` immediately verifies that the signed index will pass client verification before `SaveIndexFileAsync` is called. The guard:
1. Serializes the signed `TeamIndexFile` with `GetIndexJsonOptions()` — producing the exact bytes that will be written to disk.
2. Deserializes with client-verifier options (`PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true`, `JsonStringEnumConverter`, **no** `SmartDateTimeConverter`) — matching exactly how `SyncService` and `PresentationSelector` parse the file.
3. Calls `_ecdsa.Verify(reloaded, signingKeys.PublicKey)`. Any result other than `Valid` throws `InvalidOperationException` and aborts the publish before any file is written or pushed to the blob tier.

This catches canonical/persisted-form drift at the authoring tier — if a future change to `SmartDateTimeConverter` or the serializer options causes a byte mismatch, the error surfaces on publish rather than silently distributing an index every client will reject.

**Persisted-form signing:** The index is normalized through `GetIndexJsonOptions` before signing so the signed form equals the persisted form. `GetIndexJsonOptions` uses `SmartDateTimeConverter`, which writes whole-second timestamps; signing the in-memory object directly would cover sub-second precision that is lost on write. The index is round-tripped through `GetIndexJsonOptions` before the `Sign` call so the payload is byte-consistent with the file on disk. Verifiers must parse the persisted timestamps back to the same values (standard ISO parsing and `SmartDateTimeConverter` both do so faithfully).

**Phase B2 — complete:** TeamAdmin-gated Key Management page (`/key-management`) in NewsCentral. `IndexGenerationService.LoadTeamSigningKeysAsync` is now public; `SaveTeamSigningKeysAsync` added. The page lets a TeamAdmin (or SystemAdmin) for the current team: view the current public key (full, copyable for GPO) and truncated private key hint; generate a fresh ECDSA P-256 key pair (held in page state until applied); apply the new pair — sets `PublicKeyPrevious = old PublicKey` for rotation-window continuity and writes `team-signing.json` via `IStorageService` (never through `IBlobDistributionService`); republish the index as a separate deliberate action that triggers `GenerateAndSaveIndexAsync` (and the self-verify guard). The full private key is never displayed — `SigningKeyTool.Truncate` is used throughout. Nav item is gated on `AuthService.HasRole(currentTeamId, "TeamAdmin")` and reacts to team-context changes. Import-from-authority (paste/derive) is deferred.

**Phase C — complete (C1 + C2):** `SyncService` (NewsService, C1) and `PresentationSelector` (NewsViewer, C2) now verify `index.json` with `EcdsaSignatureService.Verify` using the team's registry public key read by `SigningKeyConfigurationReader.GetPublicKeys(configuration, teamFolderName)` — `Signing:{teamFolderName}:PublicKey` and `:PublicKeyPrevious` — with dual-key rotation fallback. Both verifiers now route through `SignatureGate.ShouldReject` (see **Phase E** below). Outcome logging with the gate: rejected → `LogError`/`Debug.WriteLine` with the gate reason string; `Valid` accepted → `LogInformation`; `Unsigned` accepted (default) → `LogWarning`; `Disabled` accepted (default) → `LogInformation`. Reject action unchanged: NewsService aborts the team sync; NewsViewer skips the team entirely. Verifiers deserialize `index.json` with standard ISO timestamp parsing and no `DateTime` converter, so the parsed values byte-match the signed, persisted form.

**Phase D — parked indefinitely:** `docs/configuration.md` and `docs/security.md` cover the per-team signing parameters and the `Signing:RequireSignedIndex` enforcement flag. The `Set-RegistryOverrides.ps1` per-team signing provisioning is parked indefinitely / not under active development.

**Phase E — complete: Fail-closed enforcement flag (`SignatureGate` + `Signing:RequireSignedIndex`):** `SignatureGate` (in `NewsCentral.Shared/Security/`) centralizes the accept/reject decision for ECDSA verification results. Both `SyncService` and `PresentationSelector` call `SignatureGate.ShouldReject(result, requireSignedIndex, out reason)` in place of inline `VerifyResult` checks.

`Signing:RequireSignedIndex` (bool, default `false`) is read from `IConfiguration` by both verifiers. Registry override: `<Component>\Signing\RequireSignedIndex` REG_SZ `"true"` or `"false"`.

| `VerifyResult` | `RequireSignedIndex = false` (default) | `RequireSignedIndex = true` |
|---|---|---|
| `Valid` | accept | accept |
| `Invalid` | **reject** | **reject** |
| `Unsigned` | accept | **reject** |
| `Disabled` | accept | **reject** |

Default `false` preserves the Phase C pass-through behavior — only `Invalid` is rejected. Set `true` to go fail-closed: unsigned indexes and teams whose public key has not been registered are rejected with the same per-component action as `Invalid`. The two measures shipped together in commit `64d3171`. `SignatureGate` is covered by 14 new xUnit facts in `NewsCentral.Shared.Tests/SignatureGateTests.cs` (full `VerifyResult × requireSignedIndex` matrix plus reason-string assertions).

**Canonical serialization and `SmartDateTimeConverter`:** `IndexGenerationService` serializes `index.json` via `JsonConfiguration.GetIndexJsonOptions()`, which includes `SmartDateTimeConverter`. This converter truncates `DateTime` values to whole-second precision before writing (UTC → `2026-05-17T14:22:00Z`; Unspecified schedule times → `2026-05-18T09:00:00`). Before signing, the index is round-tripped through these options so the payload covered by the ECDSA signature is byte-for-byte identical to what lands on disk. Verifiers (NewsService, NewsViewer) use their own `JsonDefaults.Options` (no `SmartDateTimeConverter`) and standard ISO parsing — which faithfully round-trips whole-second timestamps — so the deserialized values match the signed form. Changing the serializer options on either side without re-signing will cause all verifiers to return `Invalid`.

## Dynamic-team key delivery — key-with-content (Phase 3a — implemented and tested)

Entra-resolved **dynamic teams** are not provisioned with a registry public key, so their `index.json` carries its own verification key: `TeamIndexFile.SigningPublicKey` (Base64 SubjectPublicKeyInfo — the same form as the registry `PublicKey`). NewsCentral emits it at publish for **all** teams (`IndexGenerationService`, after signing); a static-consuming machine ignores it via precedence, a dynamic-consuming machine verifies against it. Phase 3a added the schema, the authoring emission, the shared precedence logic, and shared readers; **Phase 3b wired consumption on both tiers, so the Entra feature is now end-to-end complete** (see below).

**Excluded from the signed payload:** `SigningPublicKey` is excluded from the canonical signing input using the exact same null-and-restore mechanism that excludes `Signature` (`EcdsaSignatureService.Canonicalize`, gated by `IDeliveredKeyCarrier`), combined with `[JsonIgnore(WhenWritingNull)]` on the property. So the signature does not cover the key, and a null value leaves the canonical bytes **bit-identical** to the pre-3a form — every existing static-team signature still verifies (regression-gated by `IndexDeliveredKeyTests`).

**Precedence — `SignatureGate.VerifyWithPrecedence(index, registryPublicKeys, isDynamicTeam)`:**

| Condition | Key used | Result source |
|---|---|---|
| Registry public key configured | Registry key(s), dual-key rotation | `EcdsaSignatureService.Verify` — **registry always wins** |
| No registry key, dynamic team, `SigningPublicKey` present | Delivered key | `EcdsaSignatureService.Verify` against the delivered key |
| No registry key, dynamic team, `SigningPublicKey` absent | — | `Unsigned` |
| No registry key, **static** team | — | `Disabled` (delivered key **never** consulted) |

`ShouldReject(result, requireSignedIndex)` is unchanged; callers do `VerifyWithPrecedence → ShouldReject`.

**Anti-downgrade guarantees:** (1) the delivered key is **never** used for a static team, so an attacker cannot attach a key to downgrade a statically-trusted team; (2) a present registry key **always** overrides the delivered key, so a delivered key cannot displace a pinned registry key. Both are covered by the C3 matrix in `SignatureGatePrecedenceTests`.

**Rotation-free for dynamic teams:** because the key travels with the content and matches that content's signature, dynamic-team readers need no dual-key/`PublicKeyPrevious` rotation handling — a new key simply ships with the next index.

**Trust note:** authenticity for dynamic teams rests on **distribution-tier RBAC** (only authorized publishers can write a team's `index.json` + its `SigningPublicKey`). The model is **not** protective against an attacker who can write the distribution channel or holds local admin on the consuming machine (such an attacker could supply both a forged key and a matching signature). The `%programdata%` cache leg — protected today by cache ACLs — is where a future anchored-root/pinned-trust upgrade would harden the chain. Static teams remain anchored to registry-pinned keys and are unaffected.

**Shared helpers (Phase 3a):** `ResolvedTeamsReader.ReadDynamicTeamFolders(cacheRootPath)` (absent/unreadable/malformed → empty set, ordinal-ignore-case) and `EffectiveTeams.Union(staticTeams, dynamicTeams)` (de-duplicated, ordinal-ignore-case) — both in `NewsCentral.Shared/Configuration/`.

**Phase 3b — consumption wired (implemented and tested): the Entra feature is now end-to-end.** Both verifiers compute their team set as `EffectiveTeams.Union(static, dynamic)` — static from `TeamConfigurationReader.GetTeams`, dynamic from `ResolvedTeamsReader.ReadDynamicTeamFolders(cacheRootPath)` — and verify each team via `SignatureGate.VerifyWithPrecedence(index, GetPublicKeys(team), isDynamicTeam)` → `ShouldReject` (existing `RequireSignedIndex` policy unchanged):

- **NewsService `SyncService`** — `RefreshEntraTeamsAsync` runs first so `resolved-teams.json` reflects the current cycle; `ResolveEffectiveTeams` (unit-tested in `NewsService.Tests`) then unions static ∪ dynamic and the cycle syncs that set. A dynamic team with no published `index.json` falls through existing not-found handling (skip). The blob/share pull and cache-write mechanics are unchanged.
- **NewsViewer `PresentationSelector`** — read-only consumer (never writes `resolved-teams.json`); unions registry + dynamic teams and applies the same precedence verification. Single-winner / newest-`PresentationLastModified` display logic is unchanged. NewsViewer uses reflection-based `System.Text.Json` (no source-gen context), so `ResolvedTeamsReader` is consistent with how `index.json` is already read; the NativeAOT path is preserved.

End-to-end flow: **Entra device resolution → `resolved-teams.json` → effective-team union on both tiers → delivered-key precedence with registry-wins / anti-downgrade**. A team present in both the static list and the dynamic set is fine — `Union` de-dupes and registry-wins governs verification, so no special-casing is needed.

Session telemetry (`session-*.json`) remains on HMAC-SHA256 throughout all phases.
