# Production Deployment Preparation

> **Scope.** Everything that must exist in Azure/Entra, and everything that must be written into the

>
> **Out of scope.** MSI/Intune packaging and installer authoring (`docs/packaging.md`), the OS image
> baseline, and .NET runtime distribution.
>
> **Relationship to other docs.** This document is the *ordered sequence*; it consolidates
> `docs/azure-setup.md` (the single source for Azure entities) and `docs/configuration.md` (the single
> source for the registry surface). Where the two disagree with this document, they win — update this

## Step overview

| Step | Name | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Decide the deployment shape | Storage mode, auth mode, signing posture, dynamic teams — recorded before anything is created |
| 2 | Azure identities | Two app registrations created, credential attached, Graph permissions consented |
| 3 | Storage | Account + container created, RBAC assigned to a group and a service principal |
| 4 | Certificate | Machine certificate issued, deployed to `LocalMachine\My`, public key uploaded |
| 5 | Entra device data | *(dynamic teams only)* extensionAttributes stamped and/or groups created and populated |
| 6 | Signing keys | Per-team ECDSA key pairs generated; public keys extracted for GPO |
| 7 | Registry configuration | Two GPO-delivered registry trees authored and pushed — NewsService **and** NewsViewer |
| 8 | Validation | End-to-end proof on a pilot machine, then fail-closed switches flipped |

Steps 2-6 can run in parallel with packaging work. Step 7 depends on Step 6 (the public keys) and on the
`Company` value being final. Step 8 depends on everything.

---

## Step 1 — Decisions to record first

Each of these changes what gets created later. Settle them before touching Azure.

| Decision | Options | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Distribution tier | Azure Blob / file share | File share needs no storage account. **But if `Entra:Enabled=true`, the `AzureBlob:*` credential keys are required even in file-share mode** — the Graph reads reuse the blob credential. |
| NewsService auth mode | `Certificate` / `ClientSecret` / `ClientSecretEnv` | `Certificate` is the production answer (Step 4). The other two place a secret in clear text (registry, or a machine environment variable). |
| Signing posture | `RequireSignedIndex` `false` → `true` | Start `false` so an unsigned or mis-keyed team is *visible in the log* rather than invisible. Flip to `true` only after `Valid` is confirmed fleet-wide. |
| Dynamic teams | `Entra:Enabled` `false` / `true` | `false` = static registry team list only. `true` adds Step 5, Graph admin consent, and the pending live-validation risk below. |
| `Company` value | One string, fixed at build | Defines both the registry hive and the scheduled-task folder. Must be identical in `Directory.Build.props` and every GPO path. |
| Team folder naming | Sanitized team name | Registry `teams\` value names must match the generated folder name exactly — e.g. `cz-its`, not `CZ_ITS`, and **no `team-` prefix**. |

> ⚠️ **Entra dynamic-team resolution has not been validated live.** It is structurally complete and
> offline/fake-tested, shipping behind `Entra:Enabled=false`. The unproven seams are the DeviceId read,
> the device fetch HTTP, and `EntraGroupClient`'s name→id + `checkMemberGroups` calls. Plan a validation
> window on an Entra-joined machine before relying on it, and keep the flag off until it passes.
> See `docs/entra-dynamic-teams.md`.

## Step 2 — Azure identities

Two separate identities. They *may* be combined into one app registration configured as both public and
confidential client; keeping them separate is cleaner and is assumed here. Full detail:
`docs/azure-setup.md` §1–§2.

### 2.1 Agent — NewsService (app-only / confidential client)

The unattended identity for blob reads and, when enabled, the Graph device and group reads.

| Setting | Value | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Supported account types | Single tenant | — |
| Platform / redirect URI | None — this is a daemon | — |
| Application (client) ID | Overview blade | `AzureBlob:ClientId` |
| Directory (tenant) ID | Overview blade | `AzureBlob:TenantId` |
| Credential | Certificate (preferred) or client secret | `AzureBlob:CertificateThumbprint` / `AzureBlob:ClientSecret` |

**Microsoft Graph permissions — Application type, admin consent required:**

| Permission | Required when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Device.Read.All` | any Entra dynamic team | Reads the device object and its extensionAttributes. Omit entirely if `Entra:Enabled=false`. |
| `GroupMember.Read.All` | at least one group-team instance | Resolves group display names and checks transitive membership. |
| `Directory.Read.All` | fallback only | Broader; use only if `GroupMember.Read.All` proves insufficient at runtime (surfaces as a `403`). |
| *(none for Storage)* | — | App-only blob access is governed by RBAC, not an API permission. |

> ⚠️ **Missing admin consent surfaces as a `403`, and `403` is classified as persistent.** NewsService
> performs a clean team removal and logs an `Error` — it does not ride the grace window. That is
> deliberate so the cause is visible, but it means a forgotten consent presents as *teams disappearing*,
> not as a stall.

### 2.2 Authoring — NewsCentral (interactive / public client)

Authentication is delegated to the signed-in content author. There is no shared service account for
publishing.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Supported account types | Single tenant |
| Platform | Mobile and desktop applications |
| Redirect URI | `http://localhost` |
| Allow public client flows | **Yes** — required for `InteractiveBrowserCredential` |
| Client secret / certificate | None |
| API permissions | Azure Storage → `user_impersonation` (Delegated) |

The MSAL token is persisted in a named cache (`"NewsCentral"`), so authors see a browser prompt on first
use only. Subsequent launches refresh silently unless Conditional Access requires step-up or the refresh
token lapses.

---

## Step 3 — Storage account and RBAC

| Item | Value / setting | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Storage account name | **Without** the `.blob.core.windows.net` suffix | NewsService `AzureBlob:AccountName`, NewsCentral `AzureBlob:AccountName` |
| Container name | Default `newscentral`; auto-created by NewsCentral on first publish | NewsService `AzureBlob:ContainerName`, NewsCentral `Storage:AzureBlobContainerName` |
| Container access level | Private — no anonymous access | — |
| Shared key access | Disabled — RBAC only | — |
| Networking | Permit the agent machines / corporate proxy egress if the account uses a firewall or private endpoint | — |

### 3.1 Role assignments

| Principal | Role | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Content authors — assign to an Entra security **group**, not individuals | **Storage Blob Data Contributor** | Publish content. Group assignment lets IT manage access through normal membership changes. |
| NewsService agent service principal | **Storage Blob Data Reader** | Sync content to the local cache. Least privilege — the agent never writes content. |

> If the agent also uploads session telemetry to the same account (`Telemetry:UploadEnabled=true` with
> `StorageMode=Azure`), it needs **Storage Blob Data Contributor** instead. This is the only reason to
> widen the agent's role — decide it deliberately.

### 3.2 Proxy under Local System

NewsService runs as Local System. The default .NET `HttpClient` resolves its proxy via **WinINet**
(per-user), which is unreliable when no user profile is loaded — whereas the Intune client and Windows
Update reach the cloud via the **machine WinHTTP proxy**. If the fleet is behind a proxy:

```
AzureBlob\UseWinHttpProxy   REG_SZ   "true"
```

This routes **both** blob and Graph traffic through the machine WinHTTP proxy. Default `false` = no
behaviour change.

---

## Step 4 — Certificate

Required only when `AzureBlob:AuthMode=Certificate`. See `docs/azure-setup.md` §6.

1. Generate the certificate — internal CA template, or self-signed for a pilot. RSA 2048 or better;
   key usage Digital Signature.
2. Upload the **public** `.cer` to the agent app registration → Certificates & secrets.
3. Deploy the certificate **with its private key** to each agent machine's `Cert:\LocalMachine\My`, via
   GPO auto-enrolment or an Intune SCEP profile.
4. Record the thumbprint → `AzureBlob:CertificateThumbprint`.

Local System has read access to `LocalMachine\My` by default — no additional private-key permission
grants are required.

### 4.1 Shared vs per-machine certificate

| Option | Trade-off |
|---|---|
| **Shared** — one certificate on every agent machine, one public key on the app registration | Simple to manage and rotate. Compromise of any machine compromises the fleet credential. |
| **Per-machine** — unique certificate each; Entra supports multiple certificates per app registration | Stronger isolation and per-device auditability. Needs provisioning automation and a larger key inventory. |

Shared is the reasonable starting point for an agent holding a read-only role. Escalate if the security
team requires per-device auditability.

---

## Step 5 — Entra device data

Skip entirely if `Entra:Enabled` will be `false`. Both source kinds may be used together. Full model:
`docs/entra-dynamic-teams.md`.

### 5.1 Attribute schemes

Stamp the relevant extensionAttributes on the device objects. `Selector` names the attribute that drives
the lookup; `Mappings` translates a selector value into a team rule.

```
Entra\AttributeSchemes\{scheme}\Selector           REG_SZ  "extensionAttribute1"
Entra\AttributeSchemes\{scheme}\Mappings\{value}   REG_SZ  "extensionAttribute2-extensionAttribute5-extensionAttribute4"
```

An attribute entry's `SourceId` is the **authored scheme name** (e.g. `fat`), independent of the
resulting team folder name.

### 5.2 Group teams

For each instance, create the inclusion group and optionally a per-instance exclusion group. Optionally
create one fleet-wide exclusion group shared across every instance. Add target devices as members —
membership is evaluated **transitively**, so nested groups count.

| Registry value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Entra\GroupTeams\Instances\{label}\InclusionGroup` | Inclusion group display name — setting this **activates** the instance |
| `Entra\GroupTeams\Instances\{label}\ExclusionGroup` | Per-instance exclusion group display name (optional) |
| `Entra\GroupTeams\ExclusionGroup` | Fleet-wide exclusion group display name (optional) |

> ⚠️ **The team folder name is derived, not authored.** It is `Canonicalize(InclusionGroup)` —
> lower-case, space/underscore → `-`, strip anything outside `[a-z0-9-]`. `NewsCentral Prague ITS`
> becomes `newscentral-prague-its`, and content **must** be published under that exact folder name. The
> registry subkey `{label}` is an operator-facing label only; renaming it retargets nothing.

> ⚠️ **Inclusion group display names must be unique in the tenant.** An ambiguous name produces no team
> for that instance and is logged. An unresolvable **fleet-wide** exclusion name suppresses *every* group
> instance — it fails closed by design, logging one `Error` per cycle.

### 5.3 Caps and grace

| Value | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `Entra\Enabled` | `false` | Gates the whole feature |
| `Entra\GracePeriodMinutes` | `240` | How long a team is retained while Graph is *transiently* unreachable. Per instance, against its own last-confirmed time. `0` = no grace (deliberate and valid). |
| `Entra\MaxDynamicTeams` | `16` | Cap on total dynamic teams written across both sources; `0` = no cap. Truncates deterministically **after** the grace merge, with a `Warning` naming the dropped ids. |

> ⚠️ **All three MUST be provisioned as `REG_SZ`, never `REG_DWORD`.** `RegistryConfigurationProvider`
> coerces DWORD `0`→`"False"` and `1`→`"True"`; the int binder then throws and crashes the service at
> startup. `GracePeriodMinutes=0` and `MaxDynamicTeams=0` are both legitimate values, which is exactly
> what makes this trap live.

---

## Step 6 — Team signing keys

Each team owns an ECDSA P-256 key pair. The private key lives only in the authoring tier; the public key
is what gets deployed. See `docs/security.md` and `docs/anti-tamper.md`.

1. In NewsCentral, sign in as a **TeamAdmin** (SystemAdmin passes automatically) and open **Key
   Management**.
2. Select the team. **Generate** a new ECDSA P-256 key pair — held in page state until applied.
3. **Apply.** This sets `PublicKeyPrevious` to the outgoing `PublicKey` (rotation continuity) and writes
   `team-signing.json` into the team's authoring folder.
4. Copy the **full public key** from the page — it is rendered copyable specifically for GPO deployment.
5. **Republish** — a separate deliberate action that re-signs and saves `index.json`, with the self-verify
   guard running at publish time.
6. Repeat per team. Record each team's public key against its **exact team folder name**.

`team-signing.json` never leaves the authoring tier — it is written through `IStorageService` and is never
distributed via `IBlobDistributionService`. Public keys are **not secret**; treat them as configuration.

> ⚠️ **Rotation trap.** Signing and index regeneration are distinct operations. Regenerating indexes
> re-signs with the current key but does **not** rotate keys — and because client change detection uses
> `IndexHash` rather than the signature, regenerating with a new key on *unchanged* content does **not**
> force clients to re-sync. `PublicKeyPrevious` must remain in the registry until an actual content
> change has propagated to every machine.

> ⚠️ **Private signing keys currently live in `team-signing.json` on the authoring tier.** Azure Key
> Vault migration is the flagged highest-priority preventive measure. Until then, the authoring tier's
> backup and access control *is* the key protection.

---

## Step 7 — Registry configuration to push

Two separate trees, one per fleet component. **GPO owns this configuration entirely — the installer must
not write it** (`docs/packaging.md`). Full key surface: `docs/configuration.md`.

**M6 — generate the repository/signing values instead of hand-copying them.** NewsCentral's
Environment Management page has an **Export fleet settings** button (SystemAdmin only) for the
current environment. It generates the `Repository\`/`AzureBlob\` and `Signing\` values below for
NewsService and NewsViewer — as a `Set-RegistryOverrides.ps1` invocation (dev/pilot machines only;
see the script's own scope note) and as a `.reg` file for GPO hand-off. The fleet always
authenticates with its **own** app registration and certificate (§2.1 above), never the authoring
app's, so the export never contains the authoring `ClientId` or any credential — the fleet's
`ClientId` and certificate thumbprint are emitted as literal placeholders (`<FLEET-CLIENT-ID>`,
`<CERT-THUMBPRINT>`) that **must be replaced before use**. Everything outside this surface — Entra,
Delivery, Telemetry, Logging, Hmac, Display, Ui — is still configured by hand per
`docs/configuration.md`.

```
HKLM\Software\{Company}\NewsCentral\NewsService\
HKLM\Software\{Company}\NewsCentral\NewsViewer\
```

> ⚠️ **Each component reads only its own subkey.** The `teams\` list and the `Signing\` subtree are
> **not** shared — both must be written twice, once under `NewsService` and once under `NewsViewer`.
> Provisioning only one is a silent half-configuration: NewsService will sync content that NewsViewer
> then refuses or ignores.

### 7.1 Value type rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| `REG_SZ` for any integer | Any numeric value whose legitimate range includes `0` or `1` **must** be `REG_SZ`. DWORD `0`→`"False"`, `1`→`"True"`, and the int binder then throws at startup. |
| `REG_SZ` for doc-specified booleans | Written as `"true"`/`"false"` strings where `docs/configuration.md` specifies `REG_SZ` — `RequireSignedIndex`, `UseWinHttpProxy`, `Entra\Enabled`. |
| `DWORD` is fine for genuine booleans | `BypassDailyGate`, `BypassImageIntegrityCheck`, `Telemetry\UploadEnabled`, `Delivery\LockScreenEnabled`, `Delivery\WallpaperEnabled`, `Active` — the `0`/`1` coercion is exactly what these want. |
| `teams\` uses value **names** | The team folder name is the value *name*; the data is ignored. Write an empty string as data. |

### 7.4 Values NOT delivered by GPO

| Item | Where it lives | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Company` | Build-time constant in `Directory.Build.props` | It defines the hive path and cannot be read from the path it defines |
| `NEWSSERVICE_AZURE_CLIENTSECRET` | Machine-scope environment variable | Only when `AuthMode=ClientSecretEnv`. The single configuration item that does not arrive through GPO. **Machine scope is required** — Local System does not see user variables. |
| Team **private** signing keys | `team-signing.json`, authoring tier only | Never distributed; public keys only reach the fleet |

> ⚠️ **`ClientSecretEnv` is a convenience delivery, not a secure one.** A machine environment variable is
> clear text readable by any SYSTEM process, exactly like a registry `REG_SZ` secret. Do not present it
> to a security reviewer as hardened. `Certificate` mode is the production answer; Azure Key Vault
> remains the intended secure path.

---

## Step 8 — Validation and cutover

### 8.1 Pilot validation sequence

| # | Check | Expected result | Where to look |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GPO tree landed under the correct `Company` | Values readable under `…\NewsCentral\NewsService\` | `reg query` |
| 2 | NewsService starts and reaches the repository | `status.json` shows `isOnline: true` and the expected `syncSource` | `%ProgramData%\NewsCentral\status.json` |
| 3 | Index signature verifies | Acceptance logged as `Valid` per team on first cycle or on change | Event Log → Application, source `NewsService` |
| 4 | Content cached | `index.json` + images present under the team folder | `%ProgramData%\NewsCentral\{team}\` |
| 5 | Lock screen applied | `LockScreenImagePath` points at a `lockscreen-*` file under `Delivery:PublishedImagePath` (not the ProgramData cache) | `HKLM\…\PersonalizationCSP` |
| 6 | Poster shows once per logical day | `ViewerForm` appears at logon or unlock, once | Visual |
| 7 | Wallpaper **image** applied by NewsService and **style** re-asserted by NewsViewer | `DesktopImagePath` points at a `wallpaper-*` file under `Delivery:PublishedImagePath`; HKCU style values set on every NewsViewer run, including already-shown days | `HKLM\…\PersonalizationCSP` + Visual + `HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop` |
| 8 | Telemetry round-trip | `session-*.json` appears in `uploads\`, is forwarded, then removed | `%ProgramData%\NewsCentral\uploads\` |
| 9 | Dynamic teams *(if enabled)* | `resolved-teams.json` lists the expected teams with `State: Active` | `%ProgramData%\NewsCentral\resolved-teams.json` |
| 10 | Negative: tampered index rejected | Team skipped, `Error` logged | Event Log |

### 8.2 Flipping the fail-closed switch

Only after check 3 reports `Valid` for **every** team on **every** pilot machine:

```
NewsService\Signing\RequireSignedIndex   REG_SZ   "true"
NewsViewer\Signing\RequireSignedIndex    REG_SZ   "true"
```

From that point `Unsigned` and `Disabled` indexes are rejected alongside `Invalid`. A team missing its
public key in the registry will go dark rather than display unverified content — the intent, but it means
the key inventory must be complete first.

### 8.3 Diagnosing a silent no-op

A freshly deployed machine that behaves as though it has no configuration has one overwhelmingly likely
cause.

> ⚠️ **`Company` mismatch.** `OpenSubKey` returns `null` with no error, every GPO override is discarded,
> and the component runs on shipped defaults — NewsService finds no teams and does nothing, NewsViewer
> shows nothing. Verify that the built-in `Company` value and the GPO hive path use the **identical**
> string before investigating anything else.

Other silent-failure candidates, in order of likelihood:

- `teams\` value names do not match the generated folder names exactly (case, hyphens, a stray `team-`
  prefix).
- `Signing\` or `teams\` written under `NewsService` but not `NewsViewer`, or vice versa.
- A numeric value provisioned as `REG_DWORD` instead of `REG_SZ` — this one is *not* silent, it crashes
  the component at startup, but the crash can be mistaken for a service that never installed.
- Public key stale after a rotation where content never changed — `PublicKeyPrevious` removed too early.
- NewsViewer suppressed by the remote/virtual session guard on an RDP, Citrix, or Horizon session.

> **NewsViewer emits no runtime diagnostic logging in this release.** When a user reports "I don't see any
> news", troubleshooting is limited to verifying the NewsViewer registry tree and clearing the per-user
> gate by deleting `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NewsCentral\viewerstate.json`. EventLog logging for NewsViewer is a
> planned follow-up (`docs/packaging.md`).

## Appendix — Reference commands

**Generate the HMAC key (Base64, 32 bytes):**

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String(
    [System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(32))
```

**Verify the machine is Entra-joined:**

```powershell
dsregcmd /status        # AzureAdJoined : YES
whoami /upn             # must return user@domain, not DOMAIN\user
```

**Verify a registry tree landed:**

```powershell
reg query "HKLM\Software\{Company}\NewsCentral\NewsService" /s
reg query "HKLM\Software\{Company}\NewsCentral\NewsViewer"  /s
```

**Verify the agent certificate is present:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object Subject -like '*NewsService*'
```

**Force a NewsViewer re-display on a test machine:**

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\NewsCentral\viewerstate.json"
# or set BypassDailyGate = 1 (DWORD) on that machine only
```

**Canonicalization of a group display name:**

```
"NewsCentral Prague ITS"  ->  "newscentral-prague-its"
# lower-case; space/underscore -> '-'; strip anything outside [a-z0-9-]
```
